            Information retrieval 
                is the task, 
                        given a set of documents and a user query, 
                        finding the relevant documents
                        // find the relevant docs , according to the collection and the queries 
                Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce
                    what has been called information overload
                        // why should we gen. IR system : there are huge amount informaiton that we should manage 
                An IR system is a software that provide access to books, 
                    journals and other documents, stores them and manages the document.
                        // we can access to these books , using the system 
                Web search engines are the most visible IR applications. 
                    // Medical Imaging is the most visible application in CG 
                information retrieval process begins when
                Queries are formal statements of information needs,
                search strings in web search engines
                with different degrees of relevancy.
                opposed to classical SQL queries of a database
                compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query
                    // the key idea of our sys. is to compute a numeric score to ranking the doc. 
                        so as to provide a very quick access
                The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query
                Now the world has changed, and hundreds of millions of people engage
                    in information retrieval every day when they use a web search engine or search their email

                typically text-heavy
                an ambiguous word/term/statement 
                This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it 
                    difficult to understand using traditional programs 
                80-90% of all potentially usable business information may originate in unstructured form
                Other sources have reported similar or higher percentages of unstructured data
                majority of that will be unstructured
                    // xmajority of data that in our daily life are unstructured data 
                The earliest research into business intelligence focused in on unstructured textual data

            what is a model 
                Mathematical models are used to study the properties of 
                    the process, draw conclusions, make predictions
                derived from .. 

            boolean re. is something that very precise
            Boolean model of information retrieval (BIR)
                The BIR is based on Boolean logic and classical set theory 
                the user's query are conceived as sets of terms. 
                    //  bag of words model 
                Retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms. 
                    // has ignore the term freq. and just check if the term is included in the doc.
            why inverted 
                postings file or inverted file
                    a mapping from content
                    named in contrast to a forward index, which maps from documents to content
                        // 
                            it is named in contrast to forward index 
                            forward index maps froms documents to content 
                            inverted maps from words to documents 
                    The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full-text searches
                        //
                            to enable fast full text research , we generate an inverted index for the collection 
                        It is the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems
            Phrase Queries
                A word query is a query on a word or phrase
                    // a phrase can be 2 or more words :: the wto black albama ...
                search for documents containing an exact sentence or phrase
                searching for a certain string of text
                using quotation marks (") around a specific phrase to 
                    indicate that you want to search for instances of that search query
                    //

                handling of word endings by reducing the words to their word roots  
                    // find the root of words 
                Stemming broadens our results to include both word roots and word derivatives
                        to improve recall
                    // stemmers are used to increse recall in ir sys.
                A stemming algorithm is an algorithm that converts a word to a related form
                conversion of plurals to singulars. 
                It is the most effective and widely used
                it can only be applied to text in the English Language
                    // the porter stemmer
                the user specifies a word in a query but only a variant of this word is present in a relevant document
                This problem can be partially overcome with the substitution of stems for the words
                A stem is the portion of a word that is left after the removal of its affixes (i.e., prefixes and suffixes)
                improving retrieval performance
                affix removal, table lookup, successor variety
                    determination of morpheme boundaries 
                and n-grams.
                might require considerable storage space
                reduce the size of indexing files
                In summary, the successor variety stemming process has 3 parts:
                develop a stemmer that required little or no human processing.
                    // the systems are considered to requiring little human processing 
                    // sys should do little interaction with human 
                it facilitates the construction of an attractive user interface
                to test the correctness of our work
                    // to check if it is correct 
                we have achieved an 80% level of correctness
                Several advantages of the Successor Variety Algorithm can be observed
                    --  without the need to use a dictionary
                    -- it is basically (domain independent)
                Another advantage is that it can be used in several domains; it is basically (domain independent).

                a) The main motivation for relevance feedback and query expansion is to decrease recall.
                b) The basic idea of the Rocchio algorithm is to move the query vector towards the vectors of
                relevant documents and away from the vectors of irrelevant documents.
                c) Relevance feedback is widely available in web search engines, because users can easily
                understand it and are willing to “tune” their query.
                d) Pseudo-relevance feedback can lead to query drift. !!!
                e) In thesaurus-based query expansion, we add terms to a query which are semantically related to
                the query terms specified by the user.
                f) Thesauri can only be built manually, there is no way to build them automatically.

                In Rocchio‘s algorithm, what weight setting for 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾 does a “Find pages like this one” search
                    correspond to? &
                Why is positive feedback likely to be more useful than negative feedback to an IR system? &
                Why might only using one non-relevant document be more effective than using several? !!! &
            u8
                a) Probabilistic IR is about estimating the probability that a document is relevant to a query.
                b) The odds of an event 𝐴 is defined as 𝑂 𝐴 = 𝑃(𝐴)Τ𝑃(𝐴ҧ) .
                c) The classical Binary Independence Retrieval (BIR) model takes term frequencies into account.
                d) The BIR model assumes that terms appear independently from each other in the documents.
                e) The cluster-hypothesis states, term distributions differ between relevant and irrelevant documents.
                f) The system Okapi was a much simpler predecessor of the BIR Model.

                    what can be omitted in order to save time? &
                    Which of the calculations done so far have to be done anew for the new query? &
                    The classical BIR model does not consider term frequencies.
                        Is there a way to take these into account
                        as well?
                derived the formulas for the Retrieval Status Value:  
                    We made the assumption that terms appear independent from each other in a document
                        Provide an example of two terms for which this assumption is likely to hold and not .

                a) A statistical language model (LM) assigns probabilities to strings of symbols from some alphabet.
                b) For every unigram LM, cats hunt mice and mice hunt cats have the same probability.
                c) Language models are completely unrelated to Markov chains.

                d) We use LMs in IR like this: (step 1) we derive a LM from each document, (step 2) we rank all
                    documents by the probability that their LM generates the query.
                e) From a vocabulary containing 𝑉 terms we can construct approximately 𝑉 𝑛 𝑛-grams.

                f) A document containing 𝑑 tokens contains approximately 𝑑 𝑛 𝑛-grams.
                    // contains d vocabularies not tokens
                g) In practice, language models in IR consider 𝑛-grams with 𝑛 ≥ 3, i.e., at least tri-grams.
                h) The shorter the query, the more important is smoothing

                a) The size of the web can easily be determined by crawling the web and counting the pages.
                b) In the context of web search, information needs are the only subclass of user needs.
                c) Shingling is a technique for detecting near duplicates of web pages.

                d) The average out-degree of all web pages is higher than their average in-degree.

                a) Classification is about assigning a document to one (or more) out of several predefined categories.
                b) The accuracy of a classifier is always one minus its error rate.
                c) When using supervised learning for classification, we first train a classifier on unlabeled
                    documents.
                d) Overfitting means that a classifier is too general.
                e) With 𝑛-times 𝑘-fold cross-validation, we partition a set of 𝑛 labeled documents into 𝑘 (nearly)
                    equally-sized subsets and for each subset 𝑆𝑖 we train a classifier on the documents in 𝑆𝑖 and
                    evaluate its performance by applying it to the documents in 𝑆𝑖.
                f) Given a set of labeled documents, the sequential covering algorithm determines a set of rules for
                    rule-based text classification
                g) With probabilistic classification, a document 𝑑 is assigned to category 𝑐𝑖 if the probability 𝑃 𝑐𝑖 𝑑)
                    is the maximum of the probabilities 𝑃 𝑐𝑘 𝑑) for all categories 𝑐𝑘.
                h) Feature selection can reduce the training time of a classifier, but it cannot improve its quality.
                i) The Rocchio approach for vector-based classification assumes that the document vectors in each
                    category are close to each other, but distant from the document vectors in the other categories.
                j) The 𝑘NN classifier assigns a doc. 𝑑 to the 𝑘 categories whose centroid vectors are closest to 𝑑Ԧ.
                k) The idea of support vector machines (SVMs) is to separate the vector space using an optimal
                    hyperplane and to assign a document 𝑑 to one of two classes depending on whether 𝑑Ԧ lies on the
                    one or on the other side of the hyperplane.
                l) The SVM approach can only be applied to linearly separable datasets

                        在k-gram中，其词典由词汇表中所有单词的k-gram形式组成。最后与操作一下，注意下图引入了一个后过滤的过程（剔除一些不满足条件的单词吧）。

                Alternatively, we can use log2 800,000 ≈ 19.6 < 20 bits per docID
                goal : less than 20 bits per docID

                Variable length encoding 
                    we need a variable encoding method that uses fewer bits for short gaps

                            ElasticSearch 底层采用了 Lucene，
                                而 Lucene 的分数计算综合了布尔模型
                                (Boolean model), TF-IDF, 以及矢量空间模型。
                    BM25是一种BOW（bag-of-words）模型
                    BM25算法首先由Okapi系统实现（Okapi是伦敦城市大学实现的信息检索系统），所以又称为Okapi BM25

                        就会导致分母为零，所以通常会加上一个较小的数以保证分布不为零
                    是对tf-idf的升级：Okapi BM25 是到目前为止被认为最先进的排名算法之一

                    for each doc. we generate a LM
                    then ,we can judge which doc is likely to generate the query

                A language model is constructed -for each document -in the collection
                some of the strings in the language it generates    
                    these strings can be gen. by the LM here

                The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs
                    with some input data , state can be changed from to an other
                    the number of stats has a limit
                    external input can cause transition
                initial state, and the conditions for each transition
                A combination lock is a type of locking device
                This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows)
                An automaton is a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set
                Automata play a major role in theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.

                很多网页内容的建设者都有商业动机，因此他们希望通过操作搜索引擎的结果来获益
                在很多 Web 搜索引擎中，有可能可以通过付费来将自己的网页放入到搜索引擎的索引中，
                    这个模型称为付费收录（ paid inclusion）。
                对于是否允许付费收录、付费是否会影响搜索引擎的排名结果，不同的搜索引擎会有不同的政策

                更复杂的作弊技术还包括操纵与网页相关的元数据及指向网页的链接等

            广告经济模型
                Web 的交互性使得 CPC付费模型成为可能，用户的点击可以被网站记录和监控，然后根据记录的情况就可以给广告商寄去账单。
                对于用户的查询，搜索引擎会将“ 纯” 搜索结果（通常也被称
                    为基于算法的搜索结果）作为主要结果返回给用户，同时赞助搜索结果在算法结果的右侧独立
                    并有区别性地显示出来。

                    (i) 信息类（ informational）； 
                        用户输入信息类查询的目的往往是想从多个不同的网页中抽取信息
                    (ii) 导航类（ navigational）； 
                        这种情况下，用户最期望的结果就是汉莎航空公司的主页出现在搜索结果的第一个位置。
                    (iii) 事务类（ transactional）。
                        产品购买、文件下载或进行预订等。这种情况下，搜索引擎应该在结果中列举出
                        一些服务，它们能够提供上述事务处理的交互接口
                    分类并不容易，而类别信息不仅可以用于控制基于算法的搜索结果，也可以用于查询和赞助搜索结果的匹配当中

            Web规模估计
                估计出某个搜索引擎的索引规模占整个Web的比例仍然是非常困难的，这是因为Web中存在无数的动态网页
                每次搜索过程当中不一定会调用所有的索引
                一个网站的深层页面可能会被索引，而在一般的
                    Web 搜索中并不会被返回。但是，如果用户限定在该网站内搜索（大多数搜索引擎都提供了限
                    定在某个网站进行搜索的功能）时，则该页面会被返回
                多类页面，因此无法采用单一指标来衡量索引规模

                功能
                    鲁棒性，采集器必须要能从这类陷阱中跳出来。当然，这些陷阱倒不一定都是恶意的，有时可能是网站设计疏忽所导致的结果
                    控制访问频率：设计采集器时必须要遵守这些代表礼貌性的访问策略
                    分布式：采集器应该可以在多机上分布式运行
                    可扩展性：在增加额外的机器和带宽的情况下，采集器的架构应该允许实现采集率的提高
                    新鲜度：在很多应用中，采集器都处于连续工作状态，抓取新的协议等
                实现
                    整个采集过程可以看成是 Web 图的遍历过程
                    在抓取高质量网页的同时，采集器要满足分布式、规模可扩展、高效、礼貌性、鲁棒性及功能可扩展等一系列要求。

                                当某个 URL 加入到 URL 池时，它会被分配一个优先级，基于这个优先级来决定其最终出列真正进行采集的时机

                        如何划分？ 
                        1.地理位置划分--比如，地理位置在欧洲的采集器主要关注欧洲域名下网站的采集。当然，这种做法并不完全可靠，
                            原因包括： Internet 上数据包的传输路线并不一定反映地理位置的邻近性。 &
                            并且，在任何情况下，主机域名并不总是反映其实际的物理位置

                            重复检测模块会很复杂：
                            必须要基于指纹或 shingle 集合的某些性质对它们进行节点划分

        ppt-14-PageRank und HITS 第 21 章 链接分析 --over --c 
            链接结构信息在 Web 搜索结果排序中的使用--链接分析
            链接分析结果已经成为 Web 搜索引擎在计算某个网页的组合得分中的一个因子
            Web 搜索中链接分析思想的最早起源于引文分析领域，后者在很多方面与一个被称为文献
                计量学（ bibliometrics）的领域有交叉。这些学科试图通过分析文献之间的引用模式来量化学术
                论文的影响力。
            链接分析的意义 & -
                Web 上的链接分析方法也把超链接看成是一个网页对另一个网页的权威度的认可
                find pages with high authority
            仅仅简单地通过入链接的数目来衡量网页的质量是不够鲁棒的。
                垃圾链接
            如何选择下一个采集网页？
            链接分析的研究主要基于两个基本直觉
                去掉这些“ 内部” 的链接
            因此， Web 网页本身携带的词项和用户用于描述同一网页的词项之间往往存在着一定的差异
            举例 & -
                很多指向www.ibm.com的链接上的锚文本都包含单词computer，这个事实就可以为Web搜索引擎所使用 
            比如，锚文本中的词项就可以作为索引目标网页的词项。因此，词项computer的倒排记录表中就会包含文档www.ibm.com
            同页内词项一样，通常也会基于词频来计算锚文本词项的权重 **
            那些在多个锚文本中高频出现的词项（如Web锚文本中最普遍的词项是Click和here）会受到惩罚
            某个网站可以通过构造具有误导性的锚文本来指向自己，从而提高在某些查询词项上的排名
            在web检索工具构建过程中，需要很多作弊检测工作
            很多学者还对有效窗口的大小进行了研究--使用多少锚文本合适？ 
            web搜索引擎不同于传统文档集？

                在随机游走过程中访问越频繁的网页也越重要
                对 Web图中的每个节点赋一个 0 到 1 之间的分值，这个分值被称为 PageRank
                    给定查询，web引擎会综合各种指标：
                余弦相似度（参考 6.3 节）、词项邻近度（ 7.2.2 节）及 PageRank 等
                假设冲浪者以1/N概率跳向其他任意一个网页。当然，冲浪者也以 1/N的概率跳到其当前位置
                过程假设： & -
                    1.如果没有出链，随机游走
                    2.如果有出链alpha:随机跳转；1-alpha:继续进行随机游走
                从而，通过马尔科夫链规则，得知他就会以一个固定的时间比例 π(v)访问每个节点 v &
                +马尔科夫链： &
                    马尔科夫链是一个离散时间随机过程
                    Pij被称为转移概率，它仅仅依赖于当前的状态 i，这种性质被称为马尔科夫性
                    马尔科夫链中，下一个状态的分布仅仅依赖于当前的状态，而和如何到达当前状态无关。
                    根据P生成的随机矩阵，最大特征值是 1
                    图中链接上的数字代表的是转移概率
                    本质是一种向后迭代规则 & -
                回到网页问题：其中马尔科夫链中的每个状态对应一个网页，
                    而每个转移概率代表从一个网页跳转到另外一个网页的概率
                根据上面的规则，由N×N的临街矩阵A推导出马尔科夫链的转移概率矩阵P
                这样我们只需 状态分布和转移概率矩阵 P，就能计算冲浪者在任一时刻所处状态的概率分布
                我们将 PageRank 设置为每个节点 v 在稳态下的访问频率
                计算PageRank权重 & - p322
                    ergodic Markov chain
                    it will converge to a steady state


                    第一个条件保证从任意两个状态之间都存在非零概率转移序列，而第二个条件保证不存在这样的状态划分：
                        所有的状态转移只发生在两个划分后的状态子集之间并循环往复。
                    带随机跳转操作的最后可以得到唯一的稳态概率分布。某个状态的稳态概率就是相应网页的 PageRank
                    反复迭代一定次数之后，我们会看到分布收敛于一个稳定状态 ** 例子p322 & -
                    状态具有对称性的时候可以直接计算稳态概率分布 **

                    实际上，体育相关的集合S未必有稳态

                    马尔科夫链稳态的时候每个网页具有非零值
                    Y 中的每个网页都有非零 PageRank 值

                    比如科学宗教等

                    用户有可能显式地注册了其兴趣，或者系统能够从每个用户的历史行为中学到其兴趣

                    实际上任一用户的个性化PageRank 都可以被表示成多个面向主题的 PageRank 的线性组合

                        将根集及指向根集中的网页和根集所指向的网页加入到基本集（ base set）中

                hub 值指的是该网页的导航能力，也可以称为导航度。而 authority 值指的是网页的权威度。
                迭代算法的核心环节就是 hub 值和 authority 值的双重更新过程

                链接分析的目的：分析链接权威性，给网页打分
                任意计算特征向量的算法都可以用于计算 hub 值和 authority 值向量

                        ，并去重。这样我们就可以获得大概1000维的特征。

                            3.使用TFIDF方法计算各特征的权重得到表示该文本的特征向量
                    现在就可以方便使用KNN/SVM等方法分类的数据

                                NearMiss-1和NearMiss-2方法的描述仅有一字之差，但其含义是完全不同的：
                                    NearMiss-1考虑的是与最近的3个少数类样本的平均距离，是局部的；
                                    NearMiss-2考虑的是与最远的3个少数类样本的平均距离，是全局的。
                                论文中有对这几种方法的比较，得到的结论是NearMiss-2的效果最好
                                    ，不过这也是需要综合考虑数据集和采样比例的不同造成的影响

                                尤其是当后验分布没有一个简单的解析形式的时候更是这样：
                                    在这种情况下，后验分布可以使用 Markov chain Monte Carlo 技术来模拟，
                                    但是找到它的模的优化是很困难或者是不可能的

                                    一个本来就难以发生的事情，就算出现某个证据和他强烈相关，
                                        也要谨慎。证据很可能来自别的虽然不是很相关，但发生概率较高的事情

                                    最大似然估计是求参数θ, 使似然函数P(x0|θ)最大。最大后验概率估计则是想求θ使P(x0|θ)P(θ)最大。
                                        求得的θ不单单让似然函数大，θ自己出现的先验概率也得大
                                    MAP其实是在最大化P(θ|x0)
                                    可以减缓实验的不稳定性
                                    更好的估计？ 
                                MLE是把先验概率P(θ)认为等于1，即认为θ是均匀分布。
                                通过互信息去噪后，由于只保留了有效的特征，后验概率加大？？？

                    一种数学问题
                    二次规划是一种特殊的非线性规划
                    根据优化理论，一个点x成为全局最小值的必要条件是满足Karush-Kuhn-Tucker条件（KKT）。
                    当f(x)是凸函数时，KKT条件也是充分条件
                    当二次规划问题只有等式约束时，二次规划可以用线性方程求解。
                    否则的话，常用的二次规划解法有：
                        内点法(interior point)、
                        active set和共轭梯度法等。
                    凸集二次规划问题是凸优化问题的一个特例。

                        interior point,内点法

                        一般很难构造出完全符合输入空间的核函数，因此我们常用如下几种常用的核函数来代替自己构造核函数

                            维数是参数parameter in sklearn learn
                        高斯
                            而且其相对于多项式核函数参数要少，因此大多数情况下在不知道用什么核函数的时候，优先使用高斯核函数
